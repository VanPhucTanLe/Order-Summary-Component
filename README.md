## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Responsive CSS with the using Flexbox as the main CSS layout
Some cool transition animations implemented in basic CSS code base

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

Responsive implemented in this project is not quite significant since this is a simple product card. Hence, I really want to dig more into some responsive functionalities of CSS in the future
